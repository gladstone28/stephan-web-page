            <div class="info-card">
                <h2>Regulations and Standards</h2>
                <p>The lack of standardized codes for bamboo construction can pose challenges in obtaining building permits and ensuring compliance with local building regulations.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-card">
                <h2>Cultural Acceptance</h2>
                <p>The use of bamboo may face cultural resistance in areas where it is not traditionally used as a building material, affecting its adoption in mainstream construction.</p>
